\f0\fs24 \cf0 My favorite sport is cricket and in it, my favorite player is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He is my favorite player because he is the best leader of the Indian cricket team and has strong determination and will power. He was also rated in the 100 most influential person in 2011. \'a0Also, he was born in my state Ranchi, Jharkhand. He has a very calming attitude and renders his best scores wherever required. I desire to become like him. In his captaincy, India won the champions. He has bagged many achievements like T-20 world cup and ODI world cup. Like him, I also want to have a collection of cars and bikes. He acts as a source of motivation in my life. What makes him heroic for me is his focus and balance in troublesome situations. Also, I love watching his movie "MS Dhoni- The Untold Story." Due to his simplicity and grounded attitude he has brought success and glory to our country and also makes him my favorite player.\
